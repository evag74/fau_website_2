    <h4 class="text-center">How You Can Help:</h4>
    <h5>Filling a Pantry is as easy as 1, 2, 3!</h5>
    <h5>1. Purchase non-perishables from the grocery store on your next trip or go through your pantry and find any unopened foods that you want to donate</h5>
    <h5>2. Stop by one of the pantries – any day, any time</h5>
    <h5>3. Pull into a safe parking spot and fill the pantry</h5>
    <h5>If the pantry is already full or if it’s easier for you, food may be dropped off at B’nai Torah Congregation.</h5>
    <h5>You can also order non-perishables and have them delivered to B’nai Torah attention Summer Faerman.</h5></h5>
